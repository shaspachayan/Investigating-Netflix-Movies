# Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office


Apply the foundational skills in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python courses to manipulate and visualize movie and TV data.

# üõ†Ô∏è Description
In these projects, I‚Äôll apply the skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. I‚Äôll press ‚Äúwatch next episode‚Äù to discover if Netflix‚Äôs movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

This project helps me gain experience in an essential data science skill ‚Äî exploratory data analysis, which allows me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I create of the data.

Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex your exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. They believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. Using your friends initial research, you'll delve into the Netflix data to see if you can determine whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter and explain some of the contributing factors, if any.
